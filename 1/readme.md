# Haskell
I've never touched or used Haskell before, and it was very enjoyable!
The language offers some very good ideas (of course, it's one of the father of FP), such as guards, monad, pattern matching, lots of cool syntaxic sugars (and much more) that
make you feel smart!

However, the package management was a pain, just importing `MissingH` and `Text` was not a great experience for a begineer.
I had to stop at the second stars as I had to learn more on the ordered list, list comprehension (seems to easy to get). All the idea I had couldn't be achieved with
my basic understanding of the language and as the time of writing this I was bit sick :)

In all it's a great language, you can easily do lots of exciting stuff that makes you feel great from the beginning until you come across a big obstacle where honing on your
past none FP programming experience will be probablematic and the tools of the language won't help you much.


This is a fail, but a fun experience none the less.
